* template pattern
  template pattern divides task into two parts in general, first part is library developer
  's job, the second part is users' own job.

  not like template in CPP aiming for code generation, template pattern aims for task processing.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
running path ----->                               +--------> continue(lib part)
                  |                               |
                  |                               |
                  +--------> user's code -------> +                  (user custom part)
#+END_SRC
